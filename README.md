# Leconte Plume Internal Waves

This repository contains analysis code used in the paper titled "_Internal gravity waves generated by subglacial discharge: implications for tidewater glacier melt_" submitted to Geophysical Research Letters by: J. M. Cusack, R. H. Jackson, J. D. Nash, E. Skyllingstad, E. C. Pettit, D. A. Sutherland, R. J. Motyka, and J M. Amundson.

Some datasets were too large to upload to GitHub and are stored in the Zenodo archive:

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7679699

Download these files and move them to the `data/` directory in this repository.

One dataset from the LES (file name `l2018_1980_d150_3eq_slb_1.nc`) was too large to archive. It may be requested from the authors if needed. 

## Requirements

* UNIX-like operating system such as macOS or some flavour of LINUX
* git and wget installed on your system
* The [conda package manager](https://conda.io/en/latest/) (I recommend the lightweight version [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
* MATLAB version R2020a or greater

## Installing and removing the environment

A conda environment is specified in `environment.yml` and may be install using the appropriate bash scripts. 

To install:

```bash
./install_environment.sh
```

To remove:

```bash
./remove_environment.sh
```

These also install/remove the jupyter kernel for the environment.

> If these don't execute, you might need to change the file permissions with `chmod u+x *.sh`.
